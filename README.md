👋 Hi, I'm @MarkoJnr, and I have a passion for Python programming. I enjoy learning and building new projects with Python.

👀 I'm interested in exploring various aspects of Python, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning new techniques and best practices in Python to enhance my skills and knowledge.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with other Python enthusiasts to work on exciting projects and share ideas for new ones.
