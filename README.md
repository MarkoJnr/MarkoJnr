👋 Hi, I'm @MarkoJnr!  

🐍 I’m currently learning **Python** and enjoy building small projects as I grow my skills.  
📚 I like turning what I learn into **simple tutorials** that can help other beginners.  

👀 I’m curious about many areas of Python, especially:  
- Data analysis  
- Machine learning  
- Web development  

🌱 Right now, I’m focused on learning best practices and improving step by step.  

💡 I’d love to **collaborate with other Python learners and enthusiasts** — sharing ideas, solving problems together, and building fun projects.  

📫 Got an idea for a beginner-friendly project or want to collaborate?  
Reach me at **markjnrd@msn.com** — let’s connect and build something amazing with Python!
